    "description": "This NFT you're looking at? Just a taste of our dope future collections. Ain't like anything you've ever copped before. We're not about the basic monkey pics, dog doodles, rock replicas, or any of that nonsense. Nah, this one right here, with some patience and a bit of luck, you got a chance to bag yourself a hefty chunk of coin. You gotta hustle though, gotta find and piece together a seed phrase from a wallet that's got your reward. Count starts from the top left corner to the top right and then from left to right. Got queries? Slide into @TradeGuardian's DMs.<br>The first NFT comes with 12 spots where you could stumble across some more locations. Some are ghost towns, but some might hold a part of your seed phrase. The game starts from noon and goes clockwise. When you finally get to the right place, you'll find an Odyssey, and somewhere nearby will be your seed word. Remember, though, these spots might be empty, but there's definitely a word in the area, so stay sharp and patient. There's no trickery, no lottery, no scam – everyone who buys in is getting their prize, no doubt about it. Plus, this NFT's got a hidden CODE for a super prize, exclusive to this piece alone. Good luck, folks!",
